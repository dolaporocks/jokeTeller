# jokeTeller
This is just a fun website that features a bot that tells programming jokes. 

This project features the use of 2 APIS, A Joke API and RCSS Voice Text to Speech API.
This was created with the use of Html, Css and JavaScript.
We fetch the joke from the JokeApi and then convert it to speech using the 
RCSSAPI and then its synced to the button on the page so that when we interact with 
it, it plays the joke as an audio on the page. 
When the joke is being told, the button is disabled so that the user is unable to 
interfere with the joke being told and then once the joke is told, it is enabled.
